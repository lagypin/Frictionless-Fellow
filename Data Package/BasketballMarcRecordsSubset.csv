Subjects were 80 (men's teams = 40, women's teams = 40) head coaches employed in the NCAA Division I, II, and III varsity teams in New York and New England. The 24-item (six factors) scale developed by Duke and Corlett (1992) was used to test, the subjects. Using a one-way MANOVA analysis, no significant [Wilks' Lambda = .960, p = .802] differences were found between two groups in the six factors influencing their timeout decisions. The intercorrelations among subscales were significantly (p <.05) higher than zero except for 'Strategy' with 'Physical State of the Players' and with 'Emotional State of the Players'. The head coaches of both men's and women's teams had similar rank-order of importance for the six factors affecting their timeout decisions. In an alpha reliability analysis, four factors had unacceptable reliabilities ranging from .606 to .457; yet, the 'Physical State of the Players' (si = .841) and 'Defensive Game Events' (si = .709) were reliable measures. In addition, implications for further research are suggested.",Basketball;Coaching (Athletics);Basketball for women;Basketball coaches;Basketball coaches;Basketball;Basketball for women

"Hoffman, Jeffery D.",Sport-confidence and perceptions of coaching behavior of male and female high school basketball players /,N/A ,N/A,"Abstract: Determining the levels of confidence athletes possess, as well as the way in which athletes perceive the behaviors of their coach, are issues in sport. The participants in this study included male (n. = 39) and female (n. = 42) high school basketball players. The student-athletes were asked to voluntarily respond to the Trait Sport-Confidence Inventory (TSCI; Vealey, 1986), State Sport-Confidence Inventory (SSCI; Vealey, 1986), and the Coaching Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ; Kenow & Williams, 1992) . The negative relationship between perceptions of coaching behavior and trait and state sport-confidence was significantly (p <.05) less than zero. In addition, the mean trait and state sport-confidence scores of males were significantly (p <.05) higher than the mean trait and state sport-confidence scores of females; however, the mean perceptions of coaching behaviors was not significantly (p> .05) different for males and females. Finally, no significant (p> .05) interaction was found between competitive setting and gender of the participants with respect to perceptions of coaching behavior. Male and female high school basketball players tend to experience higher levels of confidence when they perceive their coach as displaying positive coaching behaviors; however, males tend to possess higher levels of confidence than females.",High school athletes;Basketball players;Coaching (Athletics);Self-confidence.;Coach-athlete relationships;Basketball players;Coaching (Athletics);High school athletes;Self-confidence.
